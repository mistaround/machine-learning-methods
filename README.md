- Adaboost, Nearest Neighbour(nn), Nueral Network, Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVM
- start with PCA means use PCA to reduce dimension, DimReduction use KBest selection
- svm_ovo means one vs one, ovr one vs rest
- svm_ovo_os means use oversample to solve unbalenced label, SMOTE the same
- svm_ovo_os_mean use mean imputation to fill loss feature value, nn ridge the same
